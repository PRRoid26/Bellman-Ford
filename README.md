# Bellman-Ford
Bellman-Ford Algorithm Bellman-Ford is a single source shortest path algorithm that determines the shortest path between a given source vertex and every other vertex in a graph. This algorithm can be used on both weighted and unweighted graphs.

A Bellman-Ford algorithm is also guaranteed to find the shortest path in a graph, similar to Dijkstra’s algorithm. Although Bellman-Ford is slower than Dijkstra’s algorithm, it is capable of handling graphs with negative edge weights, which makes it more versatile. The shortest path cannot be found if there exists a negative cycle in the graph. If we continue to go around the negative cycle an infinite number of times, then the cost of the path will continue to decrease (even though the length of the path is increasing). As a result, Bellman-Ford is also capable of detecting negative cycles, which is an important feature.
